# ChatBot

I have created a script that creates a chatbot which you can have a back and forth conversation with.
I used an openapi import in order to create my chat app api. The model is chatgpt-3.5-turbo.
I have created a web UI of the chatapp api using a built in open source UI called gradio as well.
